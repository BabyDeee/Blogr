## Overview

This is a simple landing page design development provided by Frontend mentor. It aids to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap

### Continued development

After this project, I'll definitely need to focus on media query and how to manipulate bootstrap to almost completely handle responsiveness issues for me.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This CSS framework helped me in building this project
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a good starting point for any beginner. You can learn a variety of things and it's easy to understand.
